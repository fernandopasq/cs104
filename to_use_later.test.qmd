## Everything as a program?

* Ada Lovelace idealized a more general purpose machine capable of far more than just numerical calculation: the automated execution of any series of instructions.
+ To Lovelace, algorithms were a way of capturing a kind of mathematical intelligence, and encoding it in a repeatable form. 
* Alan Turing theorized mathematically and generalized this idea of an algorithmic intelligence: a machine with a list of instructions + a memory (variables)

# Errors {data-name="errors"}

* A part of life in programming...

## Some tips:

* `SyntaxError`: check if you closed quotes, parentheses, etc
* `NameError`:
  + Check for misspelling variables
