    "text": "Outcomes\nThis course introduces computing as a problem solving discipline with a particular emphasis on programming. Students who complete this course will demonstrate that they can:\n\nDesign data types/structures and algorithms to solve computational problems, using:\n\nprimitive data types, expressions and arrays/lists;\nbasic control structures: sequence, selection and repetition\nsubprograms (methods/functions;\nclasses;\n\nFind and fix syntactic and logical problems in programs;\nUse an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop a program;\nUnderstand the wider social implications of encoding intelligence and knowledge in the form of algorithms.\n\nThe course technologies are based on the Python programming language, and a modern IDE. The material is considered in the context of the reformed Christian perspective.\n\n\nStaff\n\nProfessor Fernando Pasquini Santos - office hours: at NH291, Tuesdays 9-9:50am, 4-5pm, fs33@calvin.edu\nLab assistant: Grace Van Farowe, gev22@calvin.edu\nGrader: Edom Maru, eam43@calvin.edu\n\n\n\nCommunication\nOutside of class, we’ll use a variety of communication tools:\n\nPiazza — We will use Piazza for most course communication.\n\nPost questions on assignments, concepts discussed in class, or when you have problems getting code to run.\nPost answers as well. You might be able to provide a good answer before the course staff even sees the question!\nPost notes on articles or events that might be of interest to the class.\nPosts can be public or private, anonymous or not. In general, don’t post code publicly. If you have to include code, make the post private first so the course staff can decide if it’s ok to share.\n\nEmail — Please restrict email use for requests for accommodations (e.g.: missing class; disabilities; mental health; etc.).\n\nYou’ll generally find us responsive on Monday through Friday, but less so on the weekend, particularly Sunday. You’re free to schedule your work as best works for you, but we’ll be trying to observe a Sabbath in our own schedules.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\n\nZyBooks — We will be using an online text called Programming in Python 3 with ZyLabs. The text will cost $77 and can be accessed as follows:\n\nSign up at learn.zybooks.com (see Zyante’s privacy policy). Note that you must use your Calvin e-mail address (e.g., xyz27@calvin.edu).\nEnter zyBook code: **CALVINCS104Fall2023**\nClick Subscribe.\n\nYou’ll also see that ZyBooks provides reading, lab and homework assignments matching those specified in the unit preparation pages on Moodle (find these under the “Assignments” tab on the far bottom right of our course textbook page). Though the ZyBooks text is interactive, you do have the option to print a PDF version of each chapter, which can be useful as a reference after the course is over and the ZyBooks electronic submission has ended.\nActivities for CS1 in Python, T. Shepherd, C. Mayfield & H. Hu, Creative Commons — These are available online or, optionally, in paper form from the book store.\nGraphics libraries: Turtle graphics.\n\n\nPOGIL\nFrom weeks 2 to 7 the first class of a module will proceed according to a POGIL approach (Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning). We will form teams of three students in order to solve a set of exercises:\n\na programmer (runs the exercises in Thonny)\na recorder (writes the team’s answers to the exercises)\na manager/presenter (keeps the team on track; interacts with class)\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Schedule and Deadlines\nWith the exception of Unit 1, each Unit will start on a Friday and will proceed until Wednesday of next week.\nIn Class:\n\nFridays: POGIL activity introducing the unit\nMondays: examples and exercises, extra content, preparation for labs\nTuesdays: lab work\nWednesdays: weeks 1, 3, 5 and 7: perspectival reflections; weeks 2, 4 and 6: quizzes\n\nExceptionally at Unit 1, we will introduce the unit on Monday and proceed to the lab on Tuesday as usual.\nAt Home:\nFor each unit we will expect:\n\nReading assignments (at zyBooks).\n\nDeadline for Unit 1: Wednesday of the first week;\nDeadline for Unit 2: Monday of the second week;\nDeadlines for further Units: Fridays (when the Unit will be introduced);\n\nLab exercises (at zyBooks). Deadline: Fridays;\nHomework (at zyBooks), on even weeks (2, 4 and 6): Deadline: Tuesdays;\nPerspectives activities (at Moodle), on odd weeks (1, 3, 5 and 7). Deadline: Tuesdays;\nQuizzes (in class), on weeks 2, 4 and 6.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, the assignment submissions are due by midnight of the due date. The Moodle calendar will list these due dates/times.\nYou do the preparation activities on your own. You can work with others, but you must submit your own solutions to the reading exercises.\nIf feasible, you will work in pairs during the lab exercises and you may work in pairs for your homeworks as well. When you work in a pair, one of the partners should submit one copy of your work with both of your names and usernames on it. It’s wise for both partners to have copies of your shared solution. Your partner must be someone else from this course this semester.\nThe lab is configured to support the course work, but if you’re prepared to do some administrative work, you can configure your own machine to do the lab work. Alternatively, you can login remotely to the labs using a web browser. See “Getting Started” for more information.\n\n\nGrading\nWe will compute your final grade as follows:\n\n5% — Reading assignments\n5% — Perspectives\n10% — Lab exercises\n35% — Quizzes\n45% — Homeworks\n\nWe’ll throw out your lowest quiz score. Your grades will be available in the Moodle gradebook, generally before the next assignment of a similar type is due.\n\n\nUse of Technology\nWe believe that technology is not neutral: we use them, but they also affect us. Consequently, technology in the classroom changes things. Studies suggest that internet-enabled electronic devices in the classroom reduces student performance. We will use technology in class, but with limits:\n\nYou may use a smartphone or laptop to complete retrieval quizzes and polls during designated times.\nYou may use laptops to take notes or attempt programming tasks.\nBeyond those uses, technology use in class should be limited to critical messages only.\n\nFurthermore, in general, it’s not a good idea to copy code from Web sources or to use large language models (e.g., ChatGPT). Think of that as the same as cooking ready-made dinner in your microwave oven versus really learning how to cook. The results may sometimes be acceptable, but won’t be healthy and won’t put you in contact with ingredients and processes. As Christians, I believe we need to write the most humane and hospitable code we can, as a way of serving others and reflecting God’s glory. And for that, we need the disposition to fully engage with computational logic as a way of honoring God’s wisdom reflected in programming. Automating the process too much may alienate us - and our fellow people - from that, and cause a lot of problems.\nThis doesn’t mean I’m all against the use of generative AI. But we need to do that responsibly. There’s always a risk that these tools may fail and we may even not perceive it - not to mention the privacy issues. For more info on responsbile use of generative AI, see this page.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nCode re-use can be a valuable practice in computing, but reusing code or algorithms without attribution is plagiarism. If you’ve copied code with attribution, we’ll grade you on the code you wrote not on the code you copied. If we detect copying without attribution, i.e., plagiarism, we’ll be forced to give you a failing grade for the assignment and perhaps for the course. Additionally, we will report you to the office of Judicial Affairs, which may result in the incident being part of your student record.\nThe student-faculty relationship is based on trust and mutual respect, which can be seriously undermined by the suspicion or reality of academic dishonesty. Academic Dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, plagiarism (students plagiarize when they do not credit the sources of their writing - the words, information, ideas, or opinions of others), improper group work, reuse of a paper from another course and/or cheating on a test. Students are encouraged to speak to their faculty member with specific questions related to academic dishonesty. For further clarification or information, please visit https://calvin.edu/directory/policies/academic-integrity-policy.\n\n\nLate work\nWe will indicate a due date for all assignments. Anything submitted after that date is late, unless you have made prior arrangements with us. For each late assignment, you will be charged 10% for each business-day that you are late (e.g., if an assignment is due on Friday, you may turn it in on Monday at 10% off, Tuesday at 20% off and so on) and you need to email us to tell us which assignment you’re submitting late and how late it is. We will not accept work that is more than one week late unless you talk to us about the circumstances and negotiate a late-submission plan. We will generally grant up to 30% for these negotiated plans. We will also grant you 4 grace days with no penalty, no questions asked. Please note that grace days do not apply to the quizzes or the final project, and that we do not accept or negotiate for late work after the last day of class. If there are exceptional circumstances, please talk to us so we can work something out.\n\n\nEtiquette and Wellness\nI like to understand education as forming a community of friends who love knowledge (and the God from whom all knowledge comes). So as friends and community, we expect to treat each other with respect and courteous communication practices throughout the semester in all venues, including online forums. No personal attacks, trolling, or other kinds of bad language will be tolerated.\nWe are not just developing technical skill; we are also developing virtue and character through the acquisition of a technical skill. Please, take advantage of this opportunity.\nFurthermore, a wide range of things can interfere with your learning: trouble concentrating, stress/anxiety, relationship troubles, family situations, food or housing insecurity, substance use, and many more. You are encouraged to care well for yourself by keeping a consistent sleep schedule, eating well, avoiding drugs and alcohol, exercising, and taking time to relax and connect with friends and family.\nAlso, learning how to ask for help is an important part of the college experience. Many people on campus are eager to support you. The Center for Counseling and Wellness sees one out of five students each year and can connect you with a variety of mental health resources on and off campus. You can also reach out to me, another faculty/staff, a friend, or a family member you trust for help getting connected to support. You are not alone, and help is available!\n\n\nAccomodations\nCalvin University is committed to providing access to all students. If you are a student with a documented disability, please notify a disability coordinator in the Center for Student Success (located in Spoelhof University Center 360) to discuss necessary accommodations. If you have an accommodation memo, please talk to me in the first two weeks of class\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\nI intend for this class to be an environment where we equally respect people of every ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic background, political learning, religious background, etc. And I invite your help.\nWe will not always do this well. If you or someone else in this class is hurt by something I say or do in class, I would like to work to remedy it. I’ll welcome this feedback in whatever way is comfortable for you: in public, in private, or anonymously, via my department chair (Professor VanderLinden), or via a report to Safer Spaces or the provost’s office.\n\n\nStudy Sessions\nFor this course, Calvin makes available a tutoring service for helping with study. Here are the advantages of participating at Study Sessions:\n\n4-8 hours of tutoring per week\nA nice place to do homework and ask questions\nAn entire room of people working through the same challenges\nA chance to make friends and study partners\n\nThe service is completely free and flexible.
